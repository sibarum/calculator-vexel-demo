# Calculator

A small calculator window onto cott-engine.

A VexelRay desktop application. Generated from the `vexel-desktop` template, which is the reference
implementation of this stack: every seam the framework offers is already wired in the tree you are
reading.

## Run it

```
mvn compile exec:exec
```

`exec:exec` rather than `exec:java`, so native access can be enabled for Panama FFM. The window comes up where
you last left it, at 480x640 the first time.

```
mvn compile exec:exec -Dapp.args=120                      # 120 frames and quit
mvn compile exec:exec -Dautomation=0                        # a driving socket on a free port (see Taking a screenshot)
mvn compile exec:exec -Dautomation=on                     # a driving socket on the default port
mvn test                                                  # the state model and the palette
```

## The stack

Everything below is installed locally rather than downloaded, so `mvn install` in each of those projects has to
have happened at least once. If the build cannot resolve them, that is why.

| what | why it is here |
| --- | --- |
| `vexelray-gui-widget` | the widget shelf, and the framework core and draw modules behind it |
| `vexelray-gui-krono` | the clock: animations, transitions, timed events |
| `vexelray-gui-automation` | driving the running app the way a person does — a debugging instrument |
| `tactroller-atchung` | keyboard and pointer input onto an atchung bus (brings `atchung-core`) |
| `tactroller-clipboard` | the OS clipboard, with no input-subsystem coupling |
| `vexelray-os-*`, `tactroller-*` | picked by an OS-activated profile; exactly one activates |

## How it is put together

Four files carry the whole shape, and it is worth reading them in this order.

| file | what belongs in it |
| --- | --- |
| `Recipes.java` | **what this application builds.** One `@Provides` method per part; `CalculatorAppWiring`, which builds them in order, is generated from it while the project compiles. A part's phase is the latest phase of anything it takes, so there is none to declare. New parts go here. |
| `Model.java` | the one authoritative state, and the only way to change it. Every edit is a function of the current value, committed through atchung's `State`. |
| `Doc.java` | what the application knows, as one immutable record. Add fields here rather than adding state elsewhere. |
| `Ui.java` | the tree. Holds no state; `show(Doc)` writes everything derived from the document. |

`Calculator.java` is the entry point and the constants, and nothing else. What used to be there — the
**application edge**: input, the clipboard, window memory, the clock, the frame loop with its wakes and its
pacing, the dialogs, the command line and the shutdown order — is `vexelray-framework`'s. It was three hundred
lines, and it was very nearly the same three hundred lines in every application on this stack.

`Look.java`, `Type.java` and `Landmarks.java` are the three vocabularies: colour, size, and the names an
automation script is allowed to depend on.

### Phases

A phase is a **correctness** constraint rather than a scheduling detail, and having them as a type is what
makes the constraints structural instead of remembered:

| phase | what exists by then |
| --- | --- |
| `CONFIG` | the settings store and the look — values, before there is a `Gui` to apply them to |
| `MODEL` | what the application knows, before there is anything to draw it with |
| `GUI` | the `Gui` and the clock; the theme applied and the zoom range set, before the first widget |
| `TREE` | the widgets. Buildable with no window, which is what lets a test or a tool build it with no GPU |
| `WINDOW` | the device and the window handle. Main-thread from here on |
| `ATTACH` | anything that needed the handle: chrome controls, the close gate, the driving socket |

A component's phase is decided by **what it needs** — the latest phase of anything it depends on — so it is a
consequence of the code rather than a second thing to keep in agreement with it. `Shell`'s accessors refuse to
hand over what does not exist yet, so asking too early is a message naming the phase rather than a null three
frames later.

### Threading, in one paragraph

The GUI loop runs on its own thread. Every handler — a click, a text change — runs on a worker. They meet at
`Model`, whose compare-and-set puts concurrent edits in an order, and that is the only synchronisation in the
application. A listener registered with `Model.onChange` fires on the committing thread, which is also a
worker; writing a node's props from there is correct and is the framework's own idiom, because a prop written
off the GUI thread is queued and applied by the next drain. What is not allowed is the other direction:
nothing inside the frame loop reads the model.

To drive the same objects a user does from a test, hold the wiring: `VexelApplication.tree(new CalculatorAppWiring(), args)` builds as far as the tree with no window, and `wiring.model()` and `wiring.ui()` return what `Recipes` built.

## Taking a screenshot

Screenshots are `ottermate`'s, and only its: it photographs the running window on the application's own device,
so the picture is right about content as well as chrome. There is no `--capture` flag in this project on purpose.

```
ottermate shot out.png --launch mvn compile exec:exec -Dautomation=0
```

Say what the picture is *of* with options, and `ottermate` sets it first and stops if it cannot. Everything before `--launch` is ottermate's; everything after it is the application's command line:

```
ottermate --zoom 1.5 --dpi 2 --size 1600x900 shot big.png --launch ...   # pixels
ottermate --size 24emx16em shot smallest.png --launch ...                # em, at the current zoom and density
ottermate --window settings shot settings.png --launch ...               # another window of this application
```

`ottermate windows` lists the windows the application has open; `ottermate help` lists every verb. A zoom outside
the range this application allows is clamped as its own zoom control would clamp it, and the reply says so.
`docs/framework-notes.md` is where a picture that needs something `ottermate` cannot do belongs.

## Native builds

Windows, GraalVM 25 as `JAVA_HOME`, from a Visual Studio developer prompt (or after `vcvars64.bat`) so `link.exe` is
MSVC's and not Git Bash's. Two profiles build the same code as two editions:

```
mvn -Pnative-release package -DskipTests   # target/calculator.exe        what ships and is signed
mvn -Pnative package -DskipTests           # target/calculator-debug.exe  for ottermate
```

- **release** (`installer.json` points at this one): linked as a Windows GUI subsystem program, so no console window
  ever appears, and built without the automation module: the source root `src/edition-release` is compiled instead
  of `src/edition-debug` and `vexelray-*-automation` is not on its classpath, so the binary cannot open a driving
  socket (`--automation` is accepted and does nothing). stdout and stderr go nowhere; the log files are still written.
- **debug**: console subsystem, automation present: `calculator-debug.exe --automation=0` prints
  `automation: localhost:<port>` for `ottermate --launch`.

The two editions differ only in `CalculatorApp`, the `@VexelApp` declaration (one in each edition's source root);
`Calculator.java` is shared. Both profiles link `src/main/rc/calculator.rc`, the executable's icon:
`calculator.svg`, the suite icon canvas's Calculator primary, rendered to `calculator.ico` by `vex-suite-common`'s
`tools/Ico.java`; the window, file and light variants are beside it. The reachability metadata under
`src/main/resources/META-INF/native-image/` is only what is this program's (its `main`, the launcher, the locale
data); the libraries bring their own.

## Logging

The framework configures logging for you, before anything else runs, and the defaults follow what kind of run it is:

| Run | Console | File |
| --- | --- | --- |
| a test | warnings | none |
| from your checkout (`mvn exec:exec`) | info | `target/logs/calculator-vexel-demo.log`, debug |
| driven by `ottermate` or `-Dautomation` | debug | `…/calculator-vexel-demo.log`, **trace**, with a probe trace beside it |
| a native image | warnings | `~/.calculator-vexel-demo/logs/calculator-vexel-demo.log`, info |

Write to it from your own code with a logger, not `System.out`:

```java
private static final Log LOG = Log.of("myapp.save");     // sibarum.probe.Log
LOG.info("saved {} to {}", name, path);
LOG.warn("could not save {}", path, exception);          // the exception goes last; its stack reaches the file
```

`--log=debug` (or `off`) changes the level for one launch, `-Dlog.level.myapp.save=trace` raises one logger, and
`ottermate log` shows what is in force and where the file is (`ottermate log myapp.save trace` changes it in a
running window). Standard output is left for a program's own output, so nothing logs there. Levels, settings and
the rules for what belongs at which level are in `atchung/docs/logging.md`.

## The two documents

`docs/framework-notes.md` and `docs/TODO.md` start empty and are meant to be filled in as you go. See the note
at the top of the first one — it is the more important of the two.
