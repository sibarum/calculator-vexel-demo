/**
 * What this application builds — one recipe per part — and nothing about when.
 *
 * <h2>The wiring is generated from this</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code CalculatorAppWiring} is written by {@code vexelray-framework-processor} while this project compiles,
 * and lands in {@code target/generated-sources/annotations}. It calls each method below once, in the phase its
 * parameters put it in: <b>a part's phase is the latest phase of anything it takes</b>, so the look and the model,
 * which take nothing the framework builds late, exist before the {@code Gui} does, and the tree waits for the
 * {@code Gui} and its title bar. There is no phase to declare and none to get wrong: a part asking for something
 * that does not exist yet is not a part that can be written.
 *
 * <p>The driving socket is not here either. It comes from {@code AutomationStarter}, which {@link CalculatorApp}
 * names in its {@code @VexelApp} — so this application is drivable because it says so in one place, and a
 * {@code @Provides Driver} method here would replace the starter's with this application's own.
 *
 * <h2>What is not here is the point</h2>
 *
 * <p>Opening an input backend and settling its coordinate space, installing a clipboard, remembering where the
 * window was, attaching a clock, wiring the frame loop with its wakes and its pacing, parsing the command line,
 * installing the dialogs, and closing everything in the right order — every one of those used to be written out
 * by hand, and all of them are {@code vexelray-framework}'s now. So is the order this file's parts are built in,
 * and so is closing the ones that are {@code AutoCloseable}.
 *
 * <p>Adding a part is a method here. It returns an interface when other code should be able to swap it; the
 * application's own package-private classes, like {@link Model} and {@link Ui}, may be returned as they are,
 * because nothing outside this package could hold a call site against them anyway. Watch out for the case that
 * is easy to read past — an announcement depends on its <em>listeners</em>, so seeding state belongs after the
 * things it wakes up rather than beside the model it edits.

     * <p>That last part is a claim worth keeping true as this grows: a tree that can be built without a window is
     * a tree a test can build and read headlessly. It is also why the initial {@code show} is here rather than
     * later — the tree a test gets should be the tree a user gets, already carrying the document rather than
     * whatever a node was constructed with.
     *
     * <p>The title bar is the framework's. Chrome placement belongs to whoever owns the window, so that the
     * screenshot instrument in it means the same thing in every window on the desk; this application places the
     * node and supplies every colour in it.
